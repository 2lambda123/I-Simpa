Punctual Receiver data file `.recp`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

		This file contains the temporal evolution, by frequency band, of a given quantity that is homogeneous to instantaneous sound squared pressure (:math:`p^2`). Most of time, it should correspond to a punctual eceiver at the point. Typically, this type of file can represent an impulse response (RI). The actions associated with I-Simpa arise directly from the file format.

		.. important::
			The operations performed by the interface I-Simpa with this file type make sense only if the data in the file are equivalent to an instantaneous squared sound pressure (:math:`p^2`).
