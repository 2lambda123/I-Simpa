Atmospheric absorption implementation verification
-------------------------------------------------------

Presentation
#######################

This section proposes a validation of the implementation of atmospheric absorption in the numerical codes (SPPS, TCR, MD) within I-Simpa, according to ISO 9613-1, mainly in terms of reverberation time.

Geometry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Quasi cubic room (5m x 4m x 3m)
- Uniform wall diffuse reflection (100%)
- 10% uniform surface absorption
- Single source at the room center (100dB per each frequency band)
- Punctual receiver at location (1,1,1)
- Atmospheric conditions: Temperature: 20Â°C; Humidity:50%

Results
#######################

What is expected?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- a decrease of sound level and reverberation time when increasing the frequency du ti the increase of atmospheric absorption coefficient with the Frequency
- an agreement between the TCR (Classical theory of reverberation) and the SPPS/MD codes, since the room is choosen to be as closed as possible with the hypothesis of diffuse sound field.


Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The numerical simulations (see figures below) show a very good behavior of the SPPS/MD codes when considering the effect of atmospheric absorption on the reverberation time (RT30) and the sound level (SL). In terms of sound level, the deviation between simulations is around 2 dB, for higher frequencies, and are due to the inherent implementation and hypothesis of each model.
