  The following results present comparisons between numerical simulations carried out with I-Simpa and 'reference' data available in the scientific literature. Read carrefully the following limitations.

1. It is difficult to prejudge the concept of 'reference'. The deviation between the simulations and the reference data that can be observed do not necessarily call into question the corresponding simulations but can also be associated with other sources of deviation (modeling assumptions, numerical instabilities, experimental uncertainties, etc.).

2. Instead of 'real' validations, some results present some 'verifications' in order to verify that the behavior of the numerical codes is in agreement with what is expected.

3. Note also that these comparaisons can also show the limitations of the numerical codes.

4. Some numerical codes (such as SPPS code) use probabilistic methods. It means that it may have small deviations between two identic/successive simulations, due to the differences between two successive series of random number draws. In order to repeat excatly the same simulation, it could be possible to fixe the initial value of the random number draws. See for example the `Random initialization number`_ option for the SPPS code
